WORKDIR /app

# 4. Copy the requirements file into the container at /app

# 7. Make port 8000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 8000

# 8. Run main.py when the container launches
# Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server, recommended for FastAPI.
# --host 0.0.0.0 makes the application accessible from outside the container.
